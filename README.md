# Alphagana

Alphagana is a website I created to learn Japanese. As I'm currently studying hiragana, my favorite exercise involves deciphering hiragana words and translating them into romaji. Unfortunately, I couldn't find this specific type of exercise on the internet, so I decided to create my own.

## Features

- Practice Hiragana: Alphagana provides a range of hiragana words for you to practice and improve your reading skills.
- Translate Hiragana to Romaji: The main exercise involves translating hiragana words into romaji.
- Translate Romaji to Hiragana: If you have a Japanese keyboard, feel free to translate romaji words into hiragana.
- Random Word Generator: You can generate random hiragana words for endless practice opportunities.

## How to Use

1. Access the Website: [Alphagana](https://alphagana.netlify.app/).
2. Ready to use: enter the corresponding romaji translation in the provided text box.
3. Check your answers: After entering your answer, click the "VALIDATE" button to see if you got it right.
4. Get feedback: If your answer is incorrect, you'll receive the expected answer.
5. Random word generator: If you want a new set of words, click on the "NEXT" button to get a fresh challenge.
